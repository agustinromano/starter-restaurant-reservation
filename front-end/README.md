# Restaurant Reservation System

Live Application - https://restaurant-reservations-kpxa.onrender.com

Periodic Tables, a startup, is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation.
At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

## Existing files

This repository is set up as a *monorepo*, meaning that the frontend and backend projects are in one repository. This allows you to open both projects in the same editor.

The table below describes the folders in this starter repository:

| Folder/file path | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./back-end`     | The backend project, which runs on `localhost:5001` by default.  |
| `./front-end`    | The frontend project, which runs on `localhost:3000` by default. |

## Database setup

1. Set up four new ElephantSQL database instances - development, test, preview, and production - by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Creating & Deleting Databases" checkpoint.
2. After setting up your database instances, connect DBeaver to your new database instances by following the instructions in the "PostgreSQL: Installing DBeaver" checkpoint.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env`.
1. Update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
1. Run `cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env`.
1. You should not need to make changes to the `./front-end/.env` file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than `http://localhost:5001`.
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.
